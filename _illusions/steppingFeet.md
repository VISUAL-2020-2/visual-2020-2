title: Stepping Feet
---

The *stepping feet* illusion is a motion perception phenomenon involving two "buses," one blue and one yellow, moving horizontally across a "street" consisting of black and white stripes. Although both of the buses move at a constant speed, their perceived speed varies dramatically.
For this exercise we also included a third bus of green color.

Click inside the sketch to see that all of the rectangles are moving at the same speed.
