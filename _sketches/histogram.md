This sketch shows the histogram of a sample grayscale image.

the pixels corresponding to those selected shades.

You can also upload an image of your own to check it's histogram. (to allow for bigger images,
they will be displayed at half their size)

To reset the image and clear the highlighting, simply click on it.
